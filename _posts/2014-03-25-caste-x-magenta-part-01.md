<p>Our latest project seen above, is Part 01 of the collaborative piece focusing on the history, perspectives and approach surrounding the identity of France based, Magenta Skateboards. During travels to Paris, Bordeaux and San Francisco over the past year, Magenta&rsquo;s Soy Panday, Vivien Feil, Leo Valls, Jimmy Lannon, Ben Gore and Yoan Taillandier have helped illustrate the ideas that embody a brand pushing in their own direction.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this collaborative video piece, we&#39;ve released a special jacket and hat, while Magenta created a board for their summer line (including a DVD of the collaborative film series).</p>
