<p>The French music blog, <strong><a href="https://www.blogotheque.net/2011/11/14/kurt-vile/">La Blogotheque</a>, </strong>runs a cool segment on their site called &#8220;A Take-Away Show&#8221;, where different artists perform a song or two somewhere in the streets. Check out Philadelphia&#8217;s own, <strong><a href="https://kurtvile.com/">Kurt Vile</a></strong>, for his episode in their extensive library of shows. </p>
