<p>In the most recent issue of <a href="https://kingpin.mpora.com/">Kingpin</a>, UK based skateboarding magazine, we teamed up with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thistimetomorrowvideo.com/TTT/Will_Harmon.html">friends</a> across the pond and ran a <a href="https://www.samashley.com/">photo</a> contest where readers submitted their best collection of original images representing their interpretation of travel. Indonesian entrant, Fransis Magastowo, sent us some really great shots, a couple&nbsp;of which we&#39;ve&nbsp;fetured below. We&#39;re perpetual advocates of creativity here at CASTE and are honored to offer a platform for not only the CASTE family, but also to our&nbsp;constantly growing network of friends, followers and originative minds. Check out more of Magastowos photographs <a href="https://fransismagastowo.tumblr.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
