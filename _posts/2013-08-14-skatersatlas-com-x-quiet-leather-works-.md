<p>Just stumbled upon an awesome site, <a href="http://www.skatersatlas.com"><strong><a href="http://www.skatersatlas.com">www.skatersatlas.com</a></strong></a>, an online video magazine that highlights skateboarding and the culture that surrounds it. Our homie, Bill Reeves, is featured in their latest article <a href="http://www.skatersatlas.com/quiet-leather-works-with-bill-reeves/"><strong>here</strong></a>. He&#8217;s been working with leather for the past couple years now, currently based out of Denver, and has some amazing custom pieces. You can see some of what Bill has to offer on his site, <a href="http://www.quietleather.com">www.quietleather.com</a>.Â </p>
