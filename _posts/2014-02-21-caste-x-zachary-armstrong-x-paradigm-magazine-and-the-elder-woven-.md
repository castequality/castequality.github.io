<p>In the early fall of 2013, we had the pleasure of taking on a project with Ohio-born artist and friend <a href="http://zacharyarmstrong.co">Zachary Armstrong</a> in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paradigmmagazine.com">PARADIGM</a> Magazine. With several upcoming shows set for this year, our newest short, shot over the span of only a couple weeks, helps shed some light on what drives, inspires and influences Zachary, working from his Dayton studio.</p>

<p>The Elder Woven<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In connection with the dynamic style and relaxed demeanor of Zachary&rsquo;s work and personality, the Elder Woven is based off the shape of a basic lounge&nbsp;shirt. Featuring a slightly longer length, straight cut hemmed bottom, tapered open sleeves and only 4 slightly oversized buttons, the Elder defines comfort and versatility.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Each&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;has been individually hand treated and numbered from 1 to 50. Black Over-Dye : 100% Cotton</p>
