<p>Congrats to our buddy Mark Suciu on being officially welcomed to the <a href="http://www.adidas.com/com/apps/skateboarding/">Adidas Skateboarding</a> team and putting out yet another amazing part strictly filmed in Philadelphia. Our very own, Chris Mulhern, handled the filming and editing with direction from <a href="http://juicedesign.com/">Juice Design</a> out of SF. Great titles, great music, and a lot of collaborative work through the bitter east coast winter! Enjoy&#8230;</p>
