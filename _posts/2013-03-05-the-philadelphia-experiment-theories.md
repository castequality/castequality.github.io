<p>We are pleased to announce the release of &#8220;<a href="https://www.theoriesofatlantis.com/site/news/introducing_caste/"><strong>The Philadelphia Experiment</strong></a>&#8221;, a collection and video inspired by the nostalgia of our city&#8217;s past. In the video, we travel back to 1997, a time when skateboarding was at its very best in Philadelphia. The edit features Mark Suciu, Ricky Geiger, Ishod Wair, Jordan Trahan, Devon Connell, Fred Gall, Matt Reason, Ricky Oyola and many more. Head over to Josh Stewart&#8217;s site, <strong><a href="https://www.theoriesofatlantis.com">Theories of Atlantis</a></strong>, for a special interview with director/owner, Chris Mulhern, to dig into everything behind the collection, the edit, and more! Big ups to Josh for making that happen, and we are all really hyped for <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=JK7yVLzzlAI">this</a></strong>!</p>
