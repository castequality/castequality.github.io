<p>Film maker and friend <a href="http://cargocollective.com/holdtightfilms">Henry Edwards-Wood</a> has just released an informative and inspiring documentary about Southbank, London&#8217;s most icon skate space. We at CASTE have been lucky enough to spend time at Southbank and experience the incredible culture that surrounds it. Check out the film below and open your mind to the wide spectrum of positivity Southbank has brought to, not only the skateboard community, but the city of London as a whole. <a href="http://www.llsb.com/">Long Live Southbank</a>.Â </p>
